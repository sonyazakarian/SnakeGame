# 2 options: option 1: more serious/informative with complete dictionary of US colleges to actually help someone decide. 
# will take in factors like their academic portfolio, location, income, etc. 

# option 2: more goofy. specific to the Ivy Leagues too. but in order for that to actually appear legitimate, I should maybe work on it with 
# someone who goes to one of the "snobby schools"
# e.g. Top 30, which one best fits your personality?
# Or Top 200?
# How do I pick which school is best?
# I should probably have dictionary with all, but community colleges/nowhere colleges will just have less "attributes" intrinsically
# which will mean people won't get matched with them as often 


# college match or college matcher of find your college or Uni Finder or College Finder
