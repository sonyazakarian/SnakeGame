if key pressed = d:
    keep on moving the snake to the right by 1, until it hits the wall, or until the user presses a new key 



draw four squares of original snake position
if dudraw.has_next_key_typed() and dudraw.next_key_typed()=='d':
    while head_x is not >= grid_size:
        new_head stuff 

    print("Game over! You ran into the wall.")


    add square to head of snake, take square off tail
    add square to head of snake, take square off tail 
    how do you know how many times to do it?
    do this while the x coordinates of the head of snake are less than 20
    if you leave that while loop, then game ends because you hit the wall
